You can use the local user interface (local UI) by connecting directly to the local port to manage the MergePoint
Unity Switch. You can also use the remote OBWI to manage your switch system. The OBWI is web-browser
based and is launched directly from the switch, and any servers connected to the MergePoint Unity switch are
automatically detected. The two user interfaces share a similar look and feel for an optimal user experience.
Control of virtual media and smart card-capable appliances
The MergePoint Unity switches allow you to view, move or copy data located on virtual media to and from any
target device. Manage remote systems more efficiently by allowing operating system installation, operating
system recovery, hard drive recovery or duplication, BIOS updating and target device backup.
The MergePoint Unity switches allow you to use smart cards in conjunction with your MergePoint Unity switch
system. Smart cards are pocket-sized cards that store and process information. Smart cards such as the Common
Access Card (CAC) can be used to store identification and authentication to enable access to computers,
networks and secure rooms or buildings
